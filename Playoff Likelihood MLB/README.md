# Major League Baseball Playoff Appearance Likelihood

This project analyzes the likelihood of a professional baseball team making the playoffs using a form of Generalized Regression Modeling – Logistic Regression. Additionally, Poisson Regression was used to compare the home run rates of the different leagues and teams from the 1998 – 2016 seasons.

# Optimizing Likelihood of MLB Playoff Apperance

The Logistic model that was found within the above project was used to further investigate different Optimization techniques. This project analyzed the following Optimization techniques: Newton-Raphson and Quasi-Newton - along with Bootstrapping techniques to find 95% confidence intervals for the optimal model.
