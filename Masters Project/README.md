# Using Regression Modeling to Predict Single Season Total Winning Percentage for Baseball Teams

For this project, Multiple Linear Regression techniques and Penalized Regression techniques were used to create models to predict the total winning percentage of Major League Baseball teams within a single season.
The models that were choosen through model selection were then compared to the industry standard of predicting single season total winning percentage - the Pythagorean Method.
The data for this project was compiled from the *Retrosheets* individual game data from the 1871-2017 seasons and the **Teams** dataset found in the *Lahman* R package.
