This [project](https://github.com/sleiss5/OSU_Projects/tree/main/Masters%20Project) was completed as my Masters degree final project. For this project, Multiple Linear Regression techniques and Penalized Regression techniques were used to create models to predict the total winning percentage of Major League Baseball teams within a single season.

## Playoff Likelihood MLB

These [projects](https://github.com/sleiss5/OSU_Projects/tree/main/Playoff%20Likelihood%20MLB) used Generalized Regression Modeling methods and Optimization methods to investigate the likelihood of Major League Baseball teams making the playoffs using data found in the *Lahman* package within R.

## Distinguishing Between Red and White Wines
