# Data Visualizations





## Interactive and Animated MLB Plots

The following visualizations use [data](https://github.com/sleiss5/OSU_Projects/blob/main/Data%20Visualizations/Interactive%20And%20Animated%20MLB%20Plots/No%20Hitter.csv) sourced from *Baseball Reference* to inspect different aspects of and Perfect and No Hitter Baseball games thrown since the 1900 season.

* [Interactive Plot HTML](file:///C:/Users/smlov/OneDrive/Documents/OSU/Sp2021/ST%20537%20-%20Data%20Viz/Week%209/Interactive-Plot---MLB.html) and [RMD](https://github.com/sleiss5/OSU_Projects/blob/main/Data%20Visualizations/Interactive%20And%20Animated%20MLB%20Plots/Interactive%20Plot%20-%20MLB.Rmd) shows two plots: 
    * The first plot shows all No Hitters Pitched that had walks and strikeout data available, along with the pitcher's name, league, and which hand they pitched with. 
    * The second plot shows the number of No Hitters per season since 1900 broken down by strikeouts and walks per game.
